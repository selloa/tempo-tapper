### Desktop Applications
Choose the appropriate executable for your platform:

- **Windows**: `tempo_windows.exe` or `tempo_gui.exe`
- **macOS/Linux**: `tempo` or `tempo_simple`
- **All Platforms**: `tempo_gui.exe` (GUI version)

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.16 or later
- `stty` command (for Unix-like systems)

### Build Commands

```bash
# Original CLI version
go build -o tempo main.go

# Simple version
go build -o tempo_simple main_simple.go

# Windows-specific version
go build -o tempo_windows main_windows.go

# GUI version (serves HTML interface)
go build -o tempo_gui main_gui.go
```

## üìñ Usage

### Web Version
1. Open `tempo_tapper.html` in your browser
2. Tap the "TAP" button or press the spacebar to the rhythm
3. Keep a steady rhythm for accurate BPM detection
4. The BPM will be displayed in real-time

### Desktop Version
1. Run the appropriate executable for your platform
2. Tap any key to the rhythm
3. Press `Ctrl-c` to quit

## üéØ How It Works

The tempo tapper calculates BPM by measuring the intervals between your taps. It uses a rolling window of recent taps to provide accurate, real-time tempo detection. The more consistent your rhythm, the more accurate the BPM reading.
